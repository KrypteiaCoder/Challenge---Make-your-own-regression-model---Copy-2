# Challenge---Make-your-own-regression-model---Copy-2
Now that you've spent some time playing with a sample multivariate linear regression model, it's time to make your own.  You've already gotten started by prepping the FBI:UCR Crime dataset (Thinkful mirror) in a previous assignment.  Using this data, build a regression model to predict property crimes. You can use the features you prepared in the previous assignment, new features of your own choosing, or a combination. The goal here is prediction rather than understanding mechanisms, so the focus is on creating a model that explains a lot of variance.  Submit a notebook with your model and a brief writeup of your feature engineering and selection process to submit and review with your mentor.
